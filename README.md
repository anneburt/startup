# 'Blocks!' Elevator Pitch

'Blocks!' would be a great game to play in the background of meetings or class. It's simple enough that anyone can play, but tricky enough to keep players engaged. As soon as you open the website, you would be able to start playing by clicking and dragging blocks onto the board. The goal would be to create rows, columns, and 9x9 squares of blocks to create more room for new blocks.

Below are some rough sketches of the application:
